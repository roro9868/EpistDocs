# Claim Your Airdrop ðŸª™

Thank you for participating in our testnet alpha product. Your testnet tokens will be eligible to convert into mainnet tokens when we officially launch. 

Here're the recommended steps to claim your testnet airdrops:
  - [Installing a wallet](#installing-a-wallet)
  - [Get free MATIC to pay for gas fees](#get-free-matic-to-pay-for-gas-fees)
  - [Claim your tokens](#claim-your-tokens)

<br/>

## Installing a wallet
Epist operates on the Polygon network (an EVM compatible layer 2 chain). To interact with the site, you will need a cryptocurrency wallet. If your cryptocurrency is stored on an exchange (such as Binance), it does not count as a cryptocurrency wallet, and will not work. <br/>

We recommend using MetaMask.

## Get free MATIC to pay for gas fees
Make sure you have some MATIC (native tokens for Polygon) in your wallet to pay for gas fees. For the testnet airdrop, you can acquire some MATIC from the faucet for free.
