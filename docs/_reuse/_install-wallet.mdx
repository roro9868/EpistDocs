Epist operates on the Polygon network (an EVM compatible layer 2 chain). To interact with the site, you will need a cryptocurrency wallet. If your cryptocurrency is stored on an exchange (such as Binance, Coinbase), it does not count as a cryptocurrency wallet, and will not work. <br/>

We recommend using MetaMask. We also suggest that you pin the extension on Google Chrome so you do not miss any popups.
