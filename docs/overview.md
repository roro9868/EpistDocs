# Welcome to Epist ðŸ¥°

Epist is a **community-first**, web3 knowledge sharing platform **democratizing high-quality information**.  
<br/>

## ðŸ˜¤ Why Web2 Didn't Work

High quality information and advice is **sparse and hard to find**.

Existing incentive structures to share knowledge result in **suboptimal options**: 
- `Free Sources`: littered with low-quality responses and unwanted ads, plus the corporations take all the money while contributors make none
  
- `Paid Channels`: Expensive (expert networks charge $1,200/hr), yet still fail to adequately address the needs of the askers

<br/>

## ðŸ˜Ž Introducing **Epist**

By developing a **modern incentive structure** leveraging blockchain-based economics, we aim to curate a **knowledge economy**:
- `Supply`: Experts are properly incentivized to share their knowledge
- `Demand`: Question askers have a go-to resource to source high-quality answers

This cycle fuels the pace and scale at which knowledge is exchanged, creating a robust community united by a common loveðŸ’– for knowledge. 

<br/>

## ðŸ’¯ Why **Web3**?
- ðŸª™ Tokenomics introduces a new, innovative way to fairly reward experts for contributing to the knowledge economy
- Blockchain mitigates the friction in existing global financial infrastructures
- Bank accounts and payment rails are controlled by central entities that instate barriers to access (e.g. credit scores)
- By leveraging blockchain technology as the foundation of our incentive structure, Epist can engage a greater proportion of the global population
