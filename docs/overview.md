# Welcome to Epist ðŸ¥°

Epist is a **community-first**, web3 knowledge sharing platform.  
<br/>

## ðŸ˜¤ Why Web2 Didn't Work

High quality information and advice is sparse and hard to find. Incentives did not exist for people to spend time sharing their knowledge

As a result, existing options are subpar:
- Existing public sources (e.g. forums, social media) are both disparate and littered with low-quality responses and unwanted ads
- High-quality content often locked behind subscriptions & paywalls
  
<br/>

## ðŸ˜Ž Introducing Epist

By developing a **modern incentive structure** leveraging blockchain-based economics, we aim to curate a **knowledge economy**:
- `Supply`: Experts are properly incentivized to share their knowledge
- `Demand`: Askers have a go-to resource to source answers

This cycle fuels the pace and scale at which knowledge is exchanged, creating a robust community united by a common love for knowledge.
