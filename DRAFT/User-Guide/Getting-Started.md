# Getting Started 

Here're the recommended steps to getting started:
  - [Installing a wallet](#installing-a-wallet)
  - [Connecting your wallet](#connecting-your-wallet)
  - [Creating your profile on epist.xyz](#creating-your-profile-on-epistxyz)
  - [Buying EPI tokens](#buying-epi-tokens)

<br/>

## Installing a wallet
Epist operates on the Polygon network (an EVM compatible layer 2 chain). To interact with the site, you will need a cryptocurrency wallet. If your cryptocurrency is stored on an exchange (such as Binance), it does not count as a cryptocurrency wallet, and will not work. <br/>

We recommend using MetaMask.
1. [Install MetaMask on your Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en)
2. Once the application/extension has been installed, follow the instructions within the wallet to create a new cryptocurrency wallet.

<br/>

## Connecting your wallet
On any page on Epist, if your wallet is not connected, you'll see a Connect button in the top right corner.
